### Game Description

**Gorilla vs Men** is a strategic multiplayer deception game where appearances are deceiving and the ground beneath you is never what it seems. In this tense cat-and-mouse showdown, players are divided into two roles:

- **Men**: Working together yet competing individually, Men must strategically place hidden mines across the terrain to trap the mighty Gorilla. But beware - your fellow Men may intentionally place their mines to lead you into danger rather than the Gorilla!

- **Gorilla**: As the lone Gorilla, you must navigate a treacherous landscape filled with invisible traps. Trust your instincts as you reveal the terrain one step at a time, using clever deduction to avoid the mines and outlast your human opponents.

The game embodies the "Trust No One" theme through its core mechanics:
- Men can see only their own mines, never knowing where others have placed theirs
- The Gorilla must use deduction and the cascade reveal system to navigate safely
- Temporary alliances form and break as players realize only one can ultimately win

Built with React and powered by the Rune multiplayer SDK, Gorilla vs Men delivers a fast-paced battle of wits where deception is your greatest weapon and trust is a luxury you cannot afford.

### How to Play

4. Victory conditions:
